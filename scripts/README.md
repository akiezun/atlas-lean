# Repository scripts

Run `scripts/check.sh` from the repository root. With no argument it performs
the deterministic preflight checks, enforces the library trust and dependency
policies, and builds `MathlibExt`, `WantedExt`, and `MathlibExtTest`.

Use `scripts/check.sh preflight` for the fast structure and shell checks, or
`scripts/check.sh build` to build the libraries and inspect compiler diagnostics,
axiom dependencies, unsafe declarations, direct imports, and library layering.
The approved `theorem_wanted` and `def_wanted` source forms are enforced in
review using `REVIEWING.md` and the pull request checklist.
